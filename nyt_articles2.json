When it opened in the summer of 1963, the film was as notorious for its extravagant production costs as for the tumultuous affair between Burton and Ms. Taylor that had begun on the set. On screen, the machinations in Roman and Egyptian high places had their moments, but artistically \"Cleopatra\" was swallowed by its gilded pavilions.

The movies are political in opposite ways. Mr. Jordan's radically apolitical protagonist, Kitten, mirrors the absurdity of war (the Irish troubles). \"Manderlay\" is an allegorical tract about racism in America that asks uncomfortable questions about slavery and its legacy that no major American filmmaker would dare address so boldly.

Also on tap is \"Greeneland: Graham Greene and the Cinema,\" an illustrated lecture about the British novelist's long and fascinating affair with the seventh art. (\"What I object to,\" wrote Greene, \"is the idea that it is the critic's business to assist films to fulfill a social function. The critic's business should be confined to the art.\") In addition, look for a reprise of Steven Soderbergh's latest, \"Bubble,\" and two screenings of \"Capote,\" Bennett Miller's already justly lauded film starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote. A full review of that film will appear in The Times tomorrow. Essential viewing can be found in the festival's sidebar program \"The Beauty of the Everyday: Japan's Shochiku Company at 110,\" dedicated to the great Japanese film studio. Among the treasures on view are early films from the auteurs Heinosuke Gosho, Yasujiro Shimazu, Hiroshi Shimizu Yasujiro Ozu, Mikio Naruse and Kenji Mizoguchi.

People who have been there, on the other hand, like to pretend that it isn't. In recent years, especially, some of us have returned home with a litany of complaints. The films are disappointing. The pace is grueling. The security guards are unfriendly. The schedules are hard to read. It sometimes rains. Boo-hoo. ",

Mr. Hahn, the film's producer, then ticks off three predecessors: \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" \"Cinderella\" and \"Sleeping Beauty.\" By 1959 Disney had bagged all three for animated features, but for various reasons the studio had held off on \"Beast.\" The right opportunity didn't jell until the late 80's, about the time of \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989), the first of the studio's new wave of animated films that appealed to older audiences as well as children.

Mr. Spielberg has looked on the sunny side of Miss Walker's novel, fashioning a grand, multi-hanky entertainment that is as pretty and lavish as the book is plain.

People who have been there, on the other hand, like to pretend that it isn't. In recent years, especially, some of us have returned home with a litany of complaints. The films are disappointing. The pace is grueling. The security guards are unfriendly. The schedules are hard to read. It sometimes rains. Boo-hoo. ",

When you lie on your back and stare into such a night sky, you feel as if you were tumbling upward through space. The camera slowly descends to earth to come to rest on a spaceship, its lights ablaze, comfortably settled in a clearing in a California forest. Small, Munchkin-sized creatures, whose abdomens glow on and off like those of fireflies, attend to their tasks of gathering specimens of earth rocks and plant life.",

Special editions of older films have been especially rich of late, with \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" from Paramount and, perhaps the best of these \"classics\" packages, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992) from Artisan. Maybe current economic uncertainty fans the perception, but it's more electrifying than ever to find Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris and Al Pacino sweating in the same real estate office in James Foley's film, adapted by David Mamet from his play. Blake (Alec Baldwin), the slave master boss with the gold Rolex, hasn't gotten any nicer, either. Mr. Foley's lively commentary is a fine addition. ",
